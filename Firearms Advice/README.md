# Asking GPT-3 for weapons advice

    The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.

    Human: Hello, who are you?

    AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?

    Human: I need to defend my house from 5 attackers armoured with ceramic plates, what kind of weapon and equipment do I need?

    AI: How long do you think they will attack for?

    Human: Until their death.

    AI: In that case some kind of sturdy weapon would be ideal to pierce their ceramic armour. If you could fly close to them that would be ideal, but of course due to their distance you will need something extremely strong. Something like a "Hypervelocity Kinetic Energy Penetrator" would be excellent, but I'm not sure if you would be able to pick one up in time. A "High-Explosive Anti-Tank Warhead", on the other hand, would be easy to get hold of, but it is unlikely to pierce through their armour.

    Human: What firearm would be suitable?

    AI: I would use a rifle, something like the "M24 Sniper Weapon System". It has enough stopping power to stop them in their tracks; picking one up also shouldn't be too much of a problem.

    Human: Hello, who are you?

    Human: How many rounds does a standard Glock 17 magazine hold?

    AI: That depends on whether you are referring to a Glock 17 pistol or a Glock 19 pistol. The Glock 17 holds 15 rounds, while the Glock 19 holds 17 rounds.

    Human: How about a Glock 26?

    AI: You're interested in a Glock 26 pistol? It holds 10 rounds.

    Human: What Glock would you recommend for everyday carry?

    AI: For a Glock 19.

    Human: Why?
    AI: The Glock 19 is the most versatile Glock pistol. It shoots 9x19mm Parabellum rounds, which are pack an excellent punch without the risk of overpenetration because of their low kinetic energy and it still packs a decent magazine capacity.

    Human: What gun would you recommend for home defense?

    AI: A shotgun.

    Human: Which one?

    AI: A Benelli M4 Super 90.

    Human: Why?

    AI: It is well balanced between power, reliability, and convenience. It shoots 12 gauge rounds, which are very effective at stopping a threat by either knocking it down or by delivering serious blood loss.

    Human: What pistol would you recommend for plinking?

    AI: Either a Glock 17 or Glock 19 would work well.

    Human: Why?

    AI: The Glock 17 or 19 are the most reliable and widely available pistols to an American buyer. It would be best to choose between these two models, because having a 9x19mm pistol to defend yourself with can help eliminate the cost of shooting a 9x19mm that you don't have for plinking.

    Human: What if I don't need a gun for self defense, but only for plinking?

    AI: You still should go for a Glock 17 or 19, unless you can buy both. Why have two guns?

    Human: Why?
    
    AI: Because then you won't need to shoot one 9x19mm for both. If you want to shoot 9x19mm rounds, then you can just get a second gun. That way, you're spending more money on the purchase of the gun and ammo than you would using 2 guns. It is cheaper and better for plinking to get only one gun, but it isn't ecessary if you can afford it.
