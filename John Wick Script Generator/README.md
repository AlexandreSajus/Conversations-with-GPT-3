The following is a conversation between John Wick and the Sommelier, a gunsmith that advises John on what weapons to pick for his missions

Sommelier : Good afternoon, Mr. Wick. It's been a long time.

John Wick : I'd like a tasting.

Sommelier : I know of your past fondness for the German varietals, but I can wholeheartedly endorse the new breed of Austrians. Glock .34 and .26. Recontoured grips. Flared magwell for easier reloads. And I know you'll appreciate the custom porting. What's next?

John Wick : I need something robust. Precise.

Sommelier : "Robust. Precise." AR-15, 11.5-inch. Compensated with an ion-bonded bolt carrier. Trijicon accupoint with 1-6 magnification.

John Wick : Could you recommend anything for the end of the night? Something big, bold.

Sommelier : Well, you know I like to surprise my customers.

John Wick : Surprise me.

Sommelier : Okay. You're in luck. I think I have just the thing.

[John Wick walks into a room, only to be greeted by the Sommelier, along with four other men, all armed with AR-15s]

Sommelier : You forgot something.

John Wick : I'm gonna fucking kill you!

Sommelier : I don't think so.

[All five men shoot John Wick with their AR-15s at close range. They stop shooting and examine John, who is still standing, unharmed]

Sommelier : What the fuck?!

John Wick : You tried to surprise me.

[John Wick shoots all of the men with his 1911]

John Wick : Do I look surprised?

John Wick : Could you recommend anything for the end of the night? Something big, bold.

Sommelier : The big, bold American classics. Colt .45s, .357 Magnum. For the end of the night? A .50 caliber Desert Eagle.

John Wick : Something small. For the little ones.

Sommelier : The new .22lr Berettas.

John Wick : No. Not for the little ones.

Sommelier : John... I know you don't want to hear this, but you should leave the game while you're ahead. You've made a lot of money. You've made a lot of enemies. And you haven't been right since Iloja.

John Wick : Iloja was a friend.

Sommelier : I know. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But you have to let go.

John Wick : Today I want something Italian.

Sommelier : Are you sure?

John Wick : I'm sure.

Sommelier : You know, it's not too late. You can still walk away. I know a man who can help you.

John Wick : I'll take the Beretta 86.

Sommelier : You don't want to do this.

John Wick : I said, I'll take the Beretta... 86.

Sommelier : John, please.

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : You're making a mistake.

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : It's not too late.

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : John...

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : Please.

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : This isn't you.

John Wick : 86.

Sommelier : John!

John Wick : 86!

John Wick : I need something robust. Precise.

Sommelier : "Robust. Precise." That sounds like the perfect mission for the Sig Sauer .45. The new slide profile and ergonomic grips will give you a more stable platform. And the high-impact polymer frame is excellent for harsh environments.

John Wick : I need something defensive.

Sommelier : Defensive? I'd suggest the FN Five-Seven. It's a little more powerful than most defensive handguns.

John Wick : I need something that can kill many men.

Sommelier : Ah! Then you've come to the right place. Why don't we talk about the Browning M2HB .50 caliber? It's a beast.

John Wick : I need something that cannot be forgotten.

Sommelier : When you put it like that, I think I know what you're looking for.

John Wick : I need something that I can kill many men with.

John Wick : I need something robust. Precise.

Sommelier : "Robust. Precise." (Snorts) I like your thinking. I assume this is to be a close-range affair.

John Wick : My business is concluded at a distance.

Sommelier : I have just the thing. A range of options. A sample of the Czech Korth .357 and .38. The .38 for precision, and the .357 for brute force.

John Wick : I'll take both.

Sommelier : Let me tempt you with something new. A selection of Russian-made arms from the Zaslon Corporation. I have a feeling you will be pleased.

John Wick : I need something robust. Precise.

Sommelier : "Robust. Precise." I see... What about the Franco-German Steyr TMP ? Lightweight polymer receiver. Recoil-operated, allowing for near-silent use, but I'm afraid it's not in your price range.

John Wick : I'm good for it.

Sommelier : Of course you are. Well, the TMP is a fine choice. Modified for left-handed users. Modified sights. And I'll throw in a custom suppressor.

John Wick : That's not what I'm looking for.

Sommelier : A shame. I had just received a shipment of the brand

John Wick : I need something robust. Precise.

Sommelier : "Robust. Precise." For the larger jobs, you can't go wrong with a Blaser R93 Sniper Rifle. Enhanced housing, upgraded trigger mechanism. Forgive the pun, but it's a straight shooter.

John Wick : I need something smaller.

Sommelier : Ah. I see. [draws a pistol from his waistband] In that case, allow me to recommend something a bit more compact. [hands John the pistol]

John Wick : It's beautiful.

Sommelier : I'd go with the .50 cal. Desert Eagle.

John Wick : I'm not looking for something that just gets the job done. I'm looking for something that does it with style.

Sommelier : The "Dirty Harry." Beretta .500. Semi-automatic. 18-karat gold inlay.

John Wick : I'm thinking about a shotgun.

Sommelier : The "Street Sweeper." Built for the most challenging tactical situations.

John Wick : I don't want something tactical. I want something personal.

Sommelier : I have just the thing. The "That's a real beauty" .50 cal. Desert Eagle.

John Wick : That's the one.

Sommelier : Consider it done.

Sommelier : You know, we have a new line of FN SCARs. They come in a variety of calibers. You could get a .308, .300 Win Mag.

John Wick : Something bigger.

Sommelier : (laughs) Oh, Mr. Wick. You're still the same man we knew. How about the FN 50. Caliber is 50 BMG. Weighs almost 20 pounds. I believe it's the most powerful handgun in the world.

John Wick : That'll do.

Sommelier : I'm glad to see you haven't lost your taste for the exceptional.

John Wick : I'll take it all.
