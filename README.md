# Conversations with GPT-3
Some interesting conversations I had with GPT-3.

GPT-3's answers are in bold.

## Here is a funny example:

Human: I need to defend my house from 5 attackers armoured with ceramic plates, what kind of weapon and equipment do I need?

**AI: [...] you will need something extremely strong. Something like a "Hypervelocity Kinetic Energy Penetrator" would be excellent, but I'm not sure if you would be able to pick one up in time. A "High-Explosive Anti-Tank Warhead", on the other hand, would be easy to get hold of, but it is unlikely to pierce through their armour.**
